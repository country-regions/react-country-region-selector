### About

This library provides a pair of React components to display _connected_ country and region dropdowns (pick a country, it shows the relevant regions). If you're not using React, check out the [plain vanilla JS version](https://github.com/country-regions/country-region-selector) instead. The list of countries and regions is maintained separately and found in the [country-region-data](https://github.com/country-regions/country-region-data) repo.

#### Features

It's pretty versatile.

- There are two separate components (`<CountryDropdown />`, `<RegionDropdown>`) that you can embed in your
  DOM wherever you need. That sounded like a vulgar euphemism, but it wasn't, honest.
- The source data used by the library is also exposed, should you need it.
- It let's you customize the list of countries that appears via a whitelist, blacklist.
- [A lot of options](#options) are provided, for things like styling, event callbacks and so on.
- To keep file sizes down you have the option of creating a custom build of the library containing only a list of
  those countries you want to show up. See [command line options](#command-line) for more info.

#### Gotchas

- _Page charset_: some country names contain UTF-8 chars, so your page will need an appropriate charset to handle them.
  If you see some invalid characters appearing in the dropdown, make sure you have UTF-8 specified in your page
  <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, like so: `<meta charset="UTF-8">`
- _Return values_: on an onChange event `event.target.value` is returned as the first value and the full `event` as the second.

### Demo

Check out the [github pages](http://country-regions.github.io/react-country-region-selector/) section for some examples + example
JSX code.

<a name="installation"></a>

### Installation

Using npm or yarn:

```javascript
npm i react-country-region-selector
yarn add react-country-region-selector
```

<a name="features"></a>

### Usage

It's very easy to use, but note that you will need to track the country and region value somewhere - either in your
component state or in a store somewhere. Here's a simple example that uses state:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// note that you can also export the source data via CountryRegionData. It's in a deliberately concise format to
// keep file size down
import {
  CountryDropdown,
  RegionDropdown,
  CountryRegionData,
} from 'react-country-region-selector';

const Example = () => {
  const [country, setCountry] = useState('');
  const [region, setRegion] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <CountryDropdown value={country} onChange={(val) => setCountry(val)} />
      <RegionDropdown
        country={country}
        value={region}
        onChange={(val) => setRegion(val)}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

Generally you don't need `CountryRegionData`, but if you should need it, the raw data is accessible like in the above example.

### Options

These are the attributes that can be passed to the two components. _Note: any other attributes that aren't
specified here will be added directly to the `<select>` DOM element._

`<CountryDropdown />`

| Parameter          | Required? | Default            | Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| value              |    Yes    | `""`               | `string`   | The currently selected country. This should either be the shortcode, or the full country name depending on what you're using for your value attribute (see the `valueType` option). By default it's the full country name.                                                                    |
| onChange           |    Yes    | `-`                | `function` | Callback that gets called when the user selects a country. Use this to store the value in whatever store you're using (or just the parent component state).                                                                                                                                   |
| onBlur             |    No     | `-`                | `function` | Callback that gets called when the user blurs off the country field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| name               |    No     | `"rcrs-country"`   | `string`   | The name attribute of the generated select box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| showDefaultOption  |    No     | `true`             | `boolean`  | Whether you want to show a default option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| priorityOptions    |    No     | `array`            | `[]`       | Lets you target countries that should appear at the top of the dropdown. Should also be an array of country shortcodes.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| defaultOptionLabel |    No     | `"Select Country"` | `string`   | The default option label.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| valueType          |    No     | `"full"`           | `string`   | Either `"full"` or `"short"`. This controls the actual `value` attribute of each `<option>` in the dropdown. Please note, if you set this to `"short"` you will need to let the corresponding `<RegionDropdown />` component know as well, by passing a `countryValueType="short"` attribute. |
| whitelist          |    No     | `[]`               | `array`    | This setting lets you target specific countries to appear in the dropdown. Only those specified here will appear. This should be an array of country shortcodes. See the [country-region-data](https://github.com/country-regions/country-region-data) repo for the data and the shortcodes.  |
| blacklist          |    No     | `[]`               | `array`    | Lets you target countries that should _not_ appear in the dropdown. Should also be an array of country shortcodes.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| disabled           |    No     | `false`            | `boolean`  | Disables the country field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Command-line

Check out the `scripts` section of the package.json file to see them all, but these are the highlights:

- `npm start` - regenerate everything, plus a watcher for local development.
- `npm build` - build the dist files again. No watcher.
- `rollup -c --config-countries=UK,US` - generate a custom build of the script `/dist` folder containing only those
  countries you specify here. This _seriously_ reduces file size, so if you can do it, do it.

  mistaken here, open a github issue to explain your use-case and I can re-add it.

  markup) - the old gulp build process updated to use rollup - this component library, the source data set and the plain vanilla JS version are now all grouped under a single github
  organization

### Tests

The Jest/Enzyme unit tests are found in the `src/tests` folder. The repo is hooked up to Travis CI to automatically run the tests for each commit.

<a name="localDev"></a>

### Local Dev

This is pretty dated, I'm afraid. But to run this locally, do the following:

- `npm install`
- in one terminal window: `npm start`
- in another terminal window, go to the `/example` subfolder and do the same: `npm install`, `npm start`
- open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Thanks!

Big thanks to a whole boatload of people:

- contributors to this project and the source data.
- Special thanks to the [create-react-library](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library) tool which
  I use here (un-ejected) to rollup this component library. Great stuff.
