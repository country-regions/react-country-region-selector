import BasicUsage from '@site/src/components/examples/BasicUsage';

Let's get started! This first demo shows the basic usage of the script, using minimal settings. As you can see, you're
responsible for tracking state, but the tools handles rendering the appropriate countries and regions.

Where you place the components in your page is entirely up to you, so if you want a table format with labels for each field,
that's no problem.

<BasicUsage />

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { CountryDropdown, RegionDropdown } from 'react-country-region-selector';

const BasicUsage = () => {
  const [country, setCountry] = useState('');
  const [region, setRegion] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <CountryDropdown value={country} onChange={(val) => setCountry(val)} />
      <RegionDropdown
        country={country}
        value={region}
        onChange={(val) => setRegion(val)}
      />
    </>
  );
};

export default BasicUsage;
```
