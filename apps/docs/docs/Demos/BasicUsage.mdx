import BasicUsage from '@site/src/components/demos/BasicUsage';

Let's get started! This first demo shows the basic usage of the script, using minimal settings. As you can see, you're
responsible for tracking state, but the script handles rendering the appropriate countries and regions.

The script outputs raw `select` and `option` HTML elements, so any styling is up to you. However, do see the
[integrations](./integrations) section if you want to use the script with Material UI, Fluent UI or other framework
components instead of basic HTML.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { CountryDropdown, RegionDropdown } from 'react-country-region-selector';

const BasicUsage = () => {
  const [country, setCountry] = useState('');
  const [region, setRegion] = useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <CountryDropdown value={country} onChange={(val) => setCountry(val)} />
      <RegionDropdown
        country={country}
        value={region}
        onChange={(val) => setRegion(val)}
      />
    </>
  );
};

export default BasicUsage;
```
