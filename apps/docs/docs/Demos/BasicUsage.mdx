import BasicUsage from '@site/src/components/demos/BasicUsage';

Let's get started! This first demo shows the basic usage of the script, using minimal settings. As you can see, you're
responsible for tracking state, but the script handles rendering the appropriate countries and regions.

The script outputs raw `select` and `option` HTML elements, so any styling is up to you. However, do see the
[integrations](./integrations) section if you want to use the script with Material UI, Fluent UI or other framework
components instead of basic HTML.

Note the use of the extra `onChangeCountry` method which resets the region value when the country value is removed by
the user. This may or may not be needed depending on your use-case, but it's never a bad idea to ensure your state is
correct. The remaining demos won't include that callback and simply call `setCountry` instead.

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { CountryDropdown, RegionDropdown } from 'react-country-region-selector';

const BasicUsage = () => {
  const [country, setCountry] = useState('');
  const [region, setRegion] = useState('');

  const onChangeCountry = (val) => {
    setCountry(val);
    if (!val) {
      setRegion('');
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <CountryDropdown value={country} onChange={onChangeCountry} />
      <RegionDropdown
        country={country}
        value={region}
        onChange={(val) => setRegion(val)}
      />
    </>
  );
};

export default BasicUsage;
```
