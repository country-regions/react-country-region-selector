# Demos

The following pages demo all the features of the script.

- [Basic Usage](./BasicUsage): start here for a quick demonstration of how to use the components.
- [Features](./features): this section contains demos of all the available features.
- [Integrations](./integrations): by default, the components output by this package output plain HTML `<select>` and
  `<option>` elements. This section shows how you can use the package with other libraries like Material UI, using their
  own components instead.
