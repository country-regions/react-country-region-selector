title: Integrations
---

Since `4.0.0` you can now integrate `react-country-region-selector` with any external component library, like Material UI,
Fluent UI etc.

Every library has its own unique behaviours and components, so we kept the API generic to keep it as flexible as possible.
You'll be most interested in these two props:

1. `customRender`: use this prop to handle rendering whatever JSX you want
2. `customProps`. this lets pass any additional arbitrary data you want into your `customRender` method that isn't already defined
   on `CountryDropdown` and `RegionDropdown`.

These two props should make it flexible enough to accommodate any library/framework you're using, but if not, please raise an
[issue on github](https://github.com/country-regions/react-country-region-selector/issues) and explain why it's not possible in your case.

Take a look at the following integrations to see how they can be used.

_Oh - and if you do a new integration not listed here, we'd welcome PRs!_
