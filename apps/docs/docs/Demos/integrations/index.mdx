title: Integrations

Since `4.0.0` you can now integrate `react-country-region-selector` with any external script you want, like Material UI,
Semantic UI, Fluent etc.

Since each library has its own unique behaviours, JSX structure and components, we offer a generic `customRender` prop which
will get passed all the data you need to display the dropdowns. This should be flexible enough to accommodate any library/framework
but if not, please do raise an [issue on github](https://github.com/country-regions/react-country-region-selector/issues) and explain why
it's not possible in your case.

If you do a new integration not listed here, we'd welcome PRs!
