As of `4.0.2` I fixed a bug where countries with utf-8 characters weren't being sorted properly. The `Ã…land Islands` would
end up getting listed at the very end after Zimbabwe, and not with the A's. Oops!

To resolve that, this script now uses `localeCompare` for sorting. This works great, but it's quite a bit slower than the
previous sorting algorithm.

### Recommendation

If you're using the `whitelist`, `blacklist`, or `priorityOptions` props, don't pass in a fresh object as a prop each time. That'll
cause an unnecessary and expensive re-sort every time. Instead, memoize the prop instead.

I've documented this issue on those demo pages and added example code so you can see how memoization be be done. See the
[Priority Options](../demos/features/priorityOptions) as an illustration.
